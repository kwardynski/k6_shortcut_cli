# K6 Shortcut CLI
Quick and easy command line tool which displays the list of keyboard shortcuts for the [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-non-backlight-wireless-mechanical-keyboard). I bought some aftermarket keycaps for this keyboard which understandably don't have the `fn1` and `fn2` mappings printed on the keys, so printing out a list of them in the terminal will be helpful instead of having to open up a picture of the keyboard.
